# OpenFoam-Open-Channel-Flow-Tutorial
This tutorial describes simulating open channel flow in OpenFoam with environmental application.

## Open channel flow
Open channel flow is a distinct category of fluid flow (Young et al., Granger)
where there is an interface between the water and atmosphere which
is not assumed constant and also called free surface flow.
This flow type includes many applications in environmental,
coastal, hydraulic and ecological engineering such as dams, weirs, spillways, fish passages, boat wakes and hydraulic structures. There is increased use of CFD
in environmental engineering (Liu and Zhang).
Fluent and other commercial packages are available but OpenFoam is 
free and is useful as the details and source can be modified by the user.
